\section{Document identifier} \label{s:introduction:document-identifier}
	\begin{comment}
		Uniquely identify a version of the document by including information such as the date of issue, the
		issuing organization, the author(s), the approval signatures (possibly electronic), and the status/version
		(e.g., draft, reviewed, corrected, or final). Identifying information may also include the reviewers and
		pertinent managers. This information is commonly put on an early page in the document, such as the
		cover page or the pages immediately following it. Some organizations put this information at the end

\section{Scope} \label{s:introduction:scope}
	\begin{comment}
		Identify the test items (software or system) that are the object of testing, e.g., specific attributes of the
		software, the installation instructions, the user instructions, interfacing hardware, database conversion
		software that is not a part of the operational system) including their version/revision level. Also
		identify any procedures for their transfer from other environments to the test environment.
		Supply references to the test item documentation relevant to an individual level of test, if it exists, such
		as follows:
		⎯ Requirements
		⎯ Design
		⎯ User’s guide
		⎯ Operations guide
		⎯ Installation guide
		Reference any Anomaly Reports relating to the test items.
		Identify any items that are to be specifically excluded from testing.
