\chapter{Composition Viewpoint Template} \label{chp:composition-viewpoint-template}
	\begin{comment}
		The Composition viewpoint describes the way the design subject is (recursively) structured into constituent
		parts and establishes the roles of those parts.
	\end{comment}
	This viewpoint identifies major design concepts. It explains composition of provided solution, distinguishing location for each class and routines.
	\section{Design concerns} \label{s:composition-viewpoint-template:design-concerns}
		\begin{comment}
			Software developers and maintainers use this viewpoint to identify the major design constituents of the
			design subject, to localize and allocate functionality, responsibilities, or other design roles to these
			constituents. In maintenance, it can be used to conduct impact analysis and localize the efforts of making
			changes. Reuse, on the level of existing subsystems and large-grained components, can be addressed as
			well. The information in a Composition view can be used by acquisition management and in project
			management for specification and assignment of work packages, and for planning, monitoring, and control
			of a software project. This information, together with other project information, can be used in estimating
			cost, staffing, and schedule for the development effort. Configuration management may use the information
			to establish the organization, tracking, and change management of emerging work products (see
			IEEE Std 12207-2008 [B21]).

		\begin{concerns}{Library structure}{Maintenance}
			In order to manage different dependencies library is divided into parts depending on their role and way of implementation. Each new project containing computational routines should contain new implementation of \gls{CRS} and \gls{ELL} abstract solvers and specific for the platform measurement tool. New platform requires also corresponding test project.
		\end{concerns}
	\section{Design elements} \label{s:composition-viewpoint-template:design-elements}
		\begin{comment}
			Design entities: types of constituents of a system: subsystems, components, modules; ports and (provided
			and required) interfaces; also libraries, frameworks, software repositories, catalogs, and templates.
			
			Design relationships: composition, use, and generalization. The Composition viewpoint supports the
			recording of the part-whole relationships between design entities using realization, dependency,
			aggregation, composition, and generalization relationships. Additional design relationships are required and
			provided (interfaces), and the attachment of ports to components.
			
			Design attributes: For each design entity, the viewpoint provides a reference to a detailed description via
			the identification attribute. The attribute descriptions for identification, type, purpose, function, and
			definition attribute should be utilized.

	%	\subsection{Function attribute} \label{s:composition-viewpoint-template:function-attribute}
			\begin{comment}
				A statement of what the entity does. The function attribute states the transformation applied by the entity to
				its inputs to produce the output. In the case of a data entity, this attribute states the type of information
				stored or transmitted by the entity.
				
				NOTE—This design attribute is retained for compatibility with IEEE Std 1016-1998.

		%\subsection{Subordinates attribute} \label{s:subordinates-viewpoint-template:function-attribute}
			\begin{comment}
				The identification of all entities composing this entity. The subordinates attribute identifies the “composed
				of” relationship for an entity. This information is used to trace requirements to design entities and to
				identify parent/child structural relationships through a design subject.
			
				NOTE—This design attribute is retained for compatibility with IEEE Std 1016-1998. An equivalent capability is
				available through the composition relationship.

%	\section{Example languages} \label{s:composition-viewpoint-template:example-languages}
		\begin{comment}
			UML component diagrams (see OMG [B28]) cover this viewpoint. The simplest graphical technique used
			to describe functional system decomposition is a hierarchical decomposition diagram; such diagram can be
			used together with natural language descriptions of purpose and function for each entity, such as is
			provided by IDEF0 (IEEE Std 1320.1-1998 [B18]), the Structure Chart (Yourdon and Constantine [B38],
			and the HIPO Diagram. Run-time composition can also use structured diagrams (Page-Jones [B29]).
