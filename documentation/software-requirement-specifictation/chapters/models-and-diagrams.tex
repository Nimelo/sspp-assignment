\chapter{Models and Diagrams} \label{chp:models-and-diagrams}
	All the models, diagrams and approach taken will be explained and presented in details in \emph{Design Specification Document}. There are at least 2 layers of code, first one contains all the routines that were briefly introduced in Chapter \ref{chp:system-features} within requirements. The second layer contains test cases and test for the code from first layer. The last layer which can be also matched with the layer two contains performance tests on the set of predefined sparse matrices.
